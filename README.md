## Planning Story
I have started with brainstorming and creating todo lists.
I wrote down everything without any order then I categorized them by section.
Within those sections, I created workflow - the order of todos. 
Again, I compare to requirements and catch up with supplementary reading.
After a few hours of planning, I split tasks into smaller pieces.  I created a target time schedule. I tracked time how long the task and then adjust the schedule as I went.

### Unsolved Problems
- show numbers of the game without the extra click
- Would like to eventually have better-organized code, DRY code
- less click for initial create a game, show game number- add extra color.
- I would like to design for users to click less when unnecessary. i.e sign up lead to automatic sign in
- This code has a lot of show and hide and it takes a lot of adjustments.
- Adjust Size of Button and colors- create borders at the beginning for better user experience
