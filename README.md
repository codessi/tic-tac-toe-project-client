## Planning Story
I have started with brainstorming and creating todo lists.
I wrote down everything without any order then I categorized them by section.
Within those sections, I created workflow - the order of todos. 
Again, I compare to requirements and catch up with supplementary reading.
After a few hours of planning, I split tasks into smaller pieces.  I created a target time schedule. I tracked time how long the task and then adjust the schedule as I went.
